## DataforthaiWebscrapperV2

This project is a web scraper program for a specific website called DataForThai (www.dataforthai.com). It is primarily written in JavaScript to make requests to the site, perform pre-indexing, and provide utility tools for this project. We also use Pandas in Python for further analysis and table editing.

## Story of the Project

This is actually the V2 of the project. We were almost done with the last step of pulling the data we needed, but the journey was not that easy. The website we were trying to pull the data from was more complicated than we thought. The data structure was not clearly sorted out and had some conflicts in a few groups of data. So, we had to replan our project. Since everything was not going along with the first, second, or even the last plan from the V1 project, it almost felt like we had to fix everything we did, everything we coded. So, we decided to start a new one from the beginning again, and that became this V2 project as you see in this repo. I hope you, the one who got into this repo and is interested, can make good use of this study case of ours. Thank you for your interest.

## Problems and Solutions

As you knew that this is a V2 project (as I mentioned in the above topic), what problem were we facing exactly?
